## ❓ FAQ

### The funny thing is there is scientific proof

**Why Do Trenchers and Crypto Enthusiasts Share a Fascination with Conspiracies?**  
By Dr. A. R. Mendelson, Behavioral Scientist

Interestingly, trenchers—those drawn to countercultural, underground lifestyles—and cryptocurrency enthusiasts often share a curious trait: engagement with conspiratorial thinking. Psychological research explains this overlap.

Both groups operate in environments where mainstream narratives seem opaque or untrustworthy. Trenchers question norms, while crypto users navigate decentralized systems. Humans’ pattern detection fosters conspiratorial explanations.

Social networks amplify alternative theories, reinforced by confirmation bias and satisfaction of “uncovering hidden truths.” This shared fascination isn’t coincidence—it’s scientifically explainable.
