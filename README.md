## FAQ

**The funny thing is there is scientific proof**

**Why Do Trenchers and Crypto Enthusiasts Share a Fascination with Conspiracies?**  
*By Dr. A. R. Mendelson, Behavioral Scientist*

Trenchers—those drawn to underground, countercultural lifestyles—and cryptocurrency enthusiasts often share a curious trait: engagement with conspiratorial thinking.  

Both groups operate where mainstream narratives feel opaque or untrustworthy. Trenchers question societal norms; crypto users navigate decentralized systems. Humans’ natural pattern-detection favors conspiratorial explanations.  

Social networks and online communities amplify alternative theories, strengthened by confirmation bias and the satisfaction of “uncovering hidden truths.”  

> The shared fascination is scientifically explainable: cognitive bias, skepticism of authority, and social reinforcement—all combined into a fun but premium experience.
